## Solving the distribution (demand/supply) problem of selling venison

[Problem] Selling venison has a distribution challenge in particular in local areas;

* Traditional selling venison is not sustainable
* Hunters can't find buyers and buyers can't find hunters that sell venison
* Many hunters end up throwing out meat

[Solution] Online platform could help solve this problem:

1) Let people purchase local good quality venison directly from hunter. As a hunter you can sign up, offer venison (incl. photos) and let everyone know.

2) Make a sustainable and cheaper option for people who want to eat (local) venison. As a customer you can buy venison directly from a hunter using your mobile phone and a bank card.

3) Create extra income for hunters and cheaper, more sustainable options of buying venison locally. As such, this provides a connection between hunter and customer so that hunters can sell & buyers can purchase venison at any given time.

4) Additional option: Sign up as a delivery guy to pick up the venison and deliver it to the buyers
