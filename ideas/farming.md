## Solving the distribution problem of farming

Farming has a distribution challenge in developing world;

* Traditional farming is not efficent
* Distributors (mostly local gangs) sets the market price for their own profit unethically
* Individual farmers can't get paid well

And an online platform that I'll explain below could solve this problem:

1) Let people purchase better quality, organic food directly from farmer. If you are a farmer, you can sign up to this system, upload photos of your products and let the world know about what you grow.

2) Make a better option for people who want to eat healthy and affordable food. As a customer, you can purchase vegetables, fruits or bakeries directly from a farmer, using your mobile phone and a bank card.

3) Create jobs for ordinary people who need extra income. The way we provide connection between farmer and customer is simply creating independent contractor jobs for anyone who can deliver food from farmer to customer in given time. If youâ€™re someone who needs some extra income, you can simply go to my platform and pick a delivery job in your area.

In other words, I want to build an independent, fair-trade farming platform that revolutionize the way we trade food. Farmers will make more money, customers will buy organic and healthy food for cheaper, and the way we tackle the delivery problem will let ordinary people make extra income.
