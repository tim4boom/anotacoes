# anotaÃ§Ãµes

* These are my personal anotaÃ§Ãµes (notes) - I chose the Portuguese word because I think it sounds nice ğŸ˜ƒ

* I got inspired to create my own anotaÃ§Ãµes after seeing other people using this way of scribbling down their thoughts, knowledge, and really just anything. Hopefully I can add things over time, even just for remembering things. Please feel free to open any issues and pull requests if you think you could add something interesting, cool, or just funny!

* Admittedly, much of the stuff in here as of today (14/04/2020) I saw in other notebooks (e.g. Azer KoÃ§ulu). Hope you don't mind taking some of your thoughts in order to build up on them ğŸ¤“
