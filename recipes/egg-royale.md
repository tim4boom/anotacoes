[Ingredients]

* olive oil
* 4 spring onions
* ½ a clove of garlic
* 500 g baby spinach
* ½ a bunch of fresh marjoram , (15g)
* 1 whole nutmeg , for grating
* ½ a lemon
* butter , for greasing
* 4 large free-range eggs
* 200 g smoked salmon , from sustainable sources
* fresh chervil , to serve (optional)
* MUFFINS
* 450 ml tepid milk
* 1 x 7 g sachet yeast
* 2 teaspoons caster sugar
* 700 g strong white bread flour , plus extra for dusting
* 50 g semolina
* HOLLANDAISE
* 200 g unsalted butter
* 4 large free-range egg yolks
* ½ a lemon
* 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
* white wine vinegar

[Method]

* To make the muffins, place the milk in a jug, stir in the yeast and sugar, and leave for a couple of minutes until frothy.
* Place the flour and 2 teaspoons of fine sea salt into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the middle. Pour in the milk mixture and mix well to form a dough. Shape into a ball and knead with clean hands or in a freestanding mixer until smooth and elastic. Place in an oiled bowl, cover with a clean damp tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
* Knock back the dough and roll out on a flour-dusted surface to about 2cm thick. Stamp out 10 level circles with an 8cm round cutter, rerolling as necessary.
* Carefully place the muffins onto a large tray lined with a large sheet of semolina-dusted greaseproof paper and sprinkle over a little more semolina. Cover with a tea towel and leave to prove for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
* Heat a heavy non-stick pan or griddle over a low heat, add the muffins and cook for 6 to 7 minutes on each side or until golden – you may need to do this in batches. Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly.
* Meanwhile, make the hollandaise. Gently melt the butter in a small pan.
* Whisk the egg yolks, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and the mustard in a heatproof bowl set over a shallow pan of simmering water.
* Slowly pour in the melted butter, whisking constantly until well combined. Whisk in a splash of vinegar, then have a taste and season to perfection. Turn the heat off and keep warm over the pan of water, stirring occasionally. Loosen with a splash of water if needed.
* Trim, wash and finely chop the spring onions. Peel and finely slice the garlic.
* Place a large frying pan on a medium-low heat with a little drizzle of olive oil, add the spring onions, garlic and spinach, then pick in the marjoram. Finely grate over some nutmeg, then add a pinch of sea salt and some freshly ground black pepper. Cook for 5 minutes or until the spinach is dark and delicious. Add lemon juice to taste and keep warm until ready to serve.
* Place a large, shallow pan of water on a medium heat and bring to the boil.
* Grease four tea cups with butter and crack an egg into each. Place the cups in the pan of water, then cover and poach for 4 to 5 minutes or until the eggs are cooked to your liking.
* To assemble, halve 4 warm muffins and divide the spinach and smoked salmon between each. Top with a perfectly poached egg, lightly season, then spoon a tablespoon of hollandaise over each one. Finish with a final grating of nutmeg and a few sprigs of chervil, if you like.
