[Thai green curry](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/butternut-squash-recipes/thai-green-curry/)

[Ingredients]

* 1 butternut squash (1.2kg)
* groundnut oil
* 2x 400 g tins of light coconut milk
* 400 g leftover cooked greens, such as Brussels sprouts, Brussels tops, kale, cabbage, broccoli
* 350 g firm silken tofu
* 75 g unsalted peanuts
* sesame oil
* 1 fresh red chilli
* 2 limes
* CURRY PASTE
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 2 cloves garlic
* 2 shallots
* 5 cm piece of ginger
* 4 kaffir lime leaves
* 2 tablespoons fish sauce
* 4 fresh green chillies
* 2 tablespoons desiccated coconut
* 1 bunch fresh coriander (30g)
* 1 stick lemongrass
* 1 lime

[Method]

* Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4.
* Wash the squash, carefully cut it in half lengthways and remove the seeds, then cut into wedges. In a roasting tray, toss with 1 tablespoon of groundnut oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then roast for around 1 hour, or until tender and golden.
* For the paste, toast the cumin seeds in a dry frying pan for 2 minutes, then tip into a food processor.
* Peel, roughly chop and add the garlic, shallots and ginger, along with the kaffir lime leaves, 2 tablespoons of groundnut oil, the fish sauce, chillies (pull off the stalks), coconut and most of the coriander (stalks and all).
* Bash the lemongrass, remove and discard the outer layer, then snap into the processor, squeeze in the lime juice and blitz into a paste, scraping down the sides halfway.
* Put 1 tablespoon of groundnut oil into a large casserole pan on a medium heat with the curry paste and fry for 5 minutes to get the flavours going, stirring regularly.
* Tip in the coconut milk and half a tin’s worth of water, then simmer and thicken on a low heat for 5 minutes.
* Stir in the roasted squash, roughly chop and add the leftover greens and leave to tick away on the lowest heat, then taste and season to perfection.
* Meanwhile, cube the tofu and fry in a pan on a medium- high heat with 1 tablespoon of groundnut oil for 2 minutes, or until golden.
* Crush the peanuts in a pestle and mortar and toast in the tofu pan until lightly golden.
* Serve the curry topped with the golden tofu and peanuts, drizzled with a little sesame oil. Slice the chilli and sprinkle over with the reserved coriander leaves. Serve with lime wedges, for squeezing over. Great with sticky rice.
