# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# Git will not ignore the file if you've already committed it.
# Untrack the file first with this command:
# git rm -r --cached FILENAME
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# ignore ideas folder from github
